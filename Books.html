 I'm currently working with this book to reconnect with my natural voice, I've been disconnected from my true voice for more than two decates, this book is helping me work through the habitual way I used to use my voice that wasn't natural. I've set a goal to work on the exercises in this book for 2 hours every day. Having confident, authentic voice is one of the top life skills to develop if you want to succeed in anything.

There are so many benefits of humming, you can literally heal any illness with just interally and humming. This book has helped me out so much on my journey of healing and transformation. I use humming to warm up to my singing and speaking and I also combine humming techniques with voice exercises to gradually open up my natural voice. I've explored many healing rechniques during my journey of reconnecting with my true self and i found humming to be one of the most effective and gentle ways to heal yourself.

Breath is the foundation for all the other important life skills. I've been practicing coherent breathing technique described in the book and moving the breath through the body to develop better concentration, achieve emotional stability and reduce stress and anxiety. Learning breathing techniques will also help you develop your natural voice speaking skills.
