<header><h2>Reconnecting With The Power of Natural Voice</h2></header>
<p>I want to reconnect with the power of my natural, authentic voice.</p>
<p>Freeing my natural voice is a path that leads to reconnecting with my authentic self, which is what I've been trying to do for more than two decades living in the United State.</p>
<p>I have tried cognitive behavioural therapy, overcoming social anxiety, taking voice lesson, singing lesson, advanced public speaking, communication and acting classes, dating and pickiup, meetups , festivals, social clubs. None of these activities got me the results and fulfillment I aws speeking.</p>
<p>After being on a radical journey of spiritual transformation over the past three years I realized what I've been trying to do this whole time is to be myself, I've been trying to reconnect with a sense of self that I've lost since I moved to the United State.</P>
<p>Now that I'm experimenting with opening up my natural voice and my authentic style of speaking , I'm starting to reconnect with that true essense that I've lost and have been searching for all these year.</p>
<p>I have accumulated great wisdom from the journey of spiritual healing and transformation on how to reconnect with the natural voice in a gradual, gentle and loving way, and I believe sharing insights on how to do that will be of great value to other peaople. </p>
<p>When we are truly in touch with the power of our voice, speaking beacomes joy and medicine. Anything you talk about can be joy for you and medicine for other peaople. this is what I'm currently striving to accomplish by working on my own voice.</p>
<p>As I become more comfortable with my own voice, I'm hoping to connect with people beyond words, I'm hoping to express mself with the kind of energy that will speak topeaople on a soul level. I want to embody truth, love and beauty of creation and speak with the energy that will communicate all these values that I want to embody.</p>
